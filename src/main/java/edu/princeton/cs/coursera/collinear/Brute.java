 * 
 * Write a program that examines 4 points at a time and checks whether they all
 * lie on the same line segment, printing out any such line segments to standard
 * output and drawing them using standard drawing. To check whether the 4 points
 * p, q, r, and s are collinear, check whether the slopes between p and q,
 * between p and r, and between p and s are all equal. The order of growth of
 * the running time of the program should be N^4 in the worst case and it should
 * use space proportional to N.
